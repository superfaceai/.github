## Superface.ai

Integrations, generated code, and API documentation... All suck.

Superface handles the analysis of the documentation to create a Comlink that you can use to directly communicate with the API of your choice. If your app depends on multiple API integrations, Superface is the right solution for you.

The motivation behind Superface is described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvq3NXFb94) from APIdays conference.

## How it works

Superface handles the analysis of the documentation to create a Comlink that you can use to directly communicate with the API of your choice. If your app depends on multiple API integrations, Superface is the right solution for you.

This approach gives you a framework to decouple lifecycle of your application and integrations it uses.

Superface has two parts:

- **Superface CLI** for analysis and creation of Comlink profiles and maps.
- **[OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk)** for executing the integration code in your application.

Superface does not rely on any proxy. There is no integration middleman between your application and the APIs it uses.

You can read more about Superface on its [homepage](https://superface.ai) and in the [documentation](https://superface.ai/docs).
