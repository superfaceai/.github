# Welcome to Superface

Superface is a language and protocol for abstracting integrations to application use cases. It allows use case discovery and distribution of integration code at runtime.
This approach gives you a framework to decouple lifecycle of your application and integrations it uses.

# Problem we are up to

API integrations take forever to build. Theyâ€™re brittle and hard to test. APIs can change on you without notice and break your integrations. Superface is trying to change this. If your Node.js app depends on multiple API integrations Superface is right tool for you!
Our motivation behind Superface is nicely described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvq3NXFb94) from APIdays conference.

## Technology behind

<!-- One or two sentences then leading to superface.ai -->
Superface technology consists of two parts: Registry which allows use case discovery and distribution of integration code at runtime and Client executing the integration code in your application. You can read more about our technology [on Superface site](https://superface.ai) or to complete [documentation](https://superface.ai/docs).

## Get started
<!-- Par vet jak zacit, ze ted mame implementaci jenv JS/Ts a ze hlavni je OneSDK a odkazat tam -->

Superface technology can be implemented in any language, currently we provide reference Implementation for Node.js in JavaScript or TypeScript. You can start with our [reference implemetation](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js).
