## Welcome to Superface

API integrations take forever to build. Theyâ€™re brittle and hard to test. APIs can change on you without notice and break your integrations.

Superface is trying to change this. If your Node.js app depends on multiple API integrations, Superface is right tool for you!

Our motivation behind Superface is nicely described in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCvq3NXFb94) from APIdays conference.

## How it works

Superface is a language and protocol for abstracting integrations to application use cases. It allows use case discovery and distribution of integration code at runtime.

This approach gives you a framework to decouple lifecycle of your application and integrations it uses.

Superface's technology consists of two parts:

- **Registry** which allows use case discovery and distribution of integration code at runtime
- **Client** executing the integration code in your application

You can read more about the technology [on Superface's site](https://superface.ai) or check the [documentation](https://superface.ai/docs).

## Get started

Superface's technology can be implemented in any language, though currently we provide reference implementation for Node.js. For more details check [OneSDK repository](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk-js).
