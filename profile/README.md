## Superface.ai

Integrations, generated code, and API documentation... All suck.

If your app depends on multiple API integrations, Superface is the right solution for you.

Want to see it in action? [Check out the Superface CLI overview video](https://youtu.be/fb9CDqkXKzk) that demonstrates using an Open API Specification to create Comlinks that can send an email with Resend.

## How it works

Superface handles the analysis of the documentation to create a Comlink that you can use to directly communicate with the API of your choice.

This approach gives you a framework to decouple lifecycle of your application and integrations it uses.

Superface has two parts:

- **Superface CLI** for analysis and creation of Comlinks.
- **[OneSDK](https://github.com/superfaceai/one-sdk)** for executing the integration code in your application.

Superface does not rely on any proxy. There is no integration middleman between your application and the APIs it uses.

## Get started today

You can install the Superface CLI via Homebrew:

```
brew install superfaceai/cli/superface
```
